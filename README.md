# AES 1920 bits Encryption Cipher
Advanced Encryption Standard with 1920-bit keys.

AES256 uses 256-bit keys. However, the internal keys are much larger.
AES256 uses the 256-bit keys to generate the 60 * 32-bit subkeys, or 1920 bits.

The 256-bit limitation of the key is artificial, so it can be enlarged up to 1920 bits.

In 2016 AES-1920 was released, it uses the same principle as the AES but the 60 subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function.

The result is an algorithm that works at the same speed as the AES-256 but with a 1920-bit key.
